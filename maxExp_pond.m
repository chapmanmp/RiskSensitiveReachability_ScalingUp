% DESCRIPTION: For each i, approximates max_R\inRiskEnvelope { E[ R*J_k+1(x_k+1,ls(i)*R) | x_k, ls(i), u_k ] }
%              Uses Chow 2015 linear interpolation method on confidence level
%              Uses change of variable, Z := y*R 
% INPUT: 
    % J_k+1 : optimal cost-to-go at time k+1, array
    % x : state at time k, real number
    % u : control at time k, real number
    % xs : x values, row vector
    % ls : confidence levels, row vector
    % ws(i): ith possible value of w_k
    % P(i): probability that w_k = ws(i)
    % dt : duration of [k,k+1) interval
    % area_pond : approx. surface area of pond
% OUTPUT: bigexp(i) ~= max_R\inRiskEnvelope { E[ R*J_k+1(x_k+1,ls(i)*R) | x_k, ls(i), u_k ] }
