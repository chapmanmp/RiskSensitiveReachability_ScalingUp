% DESCRIPTION: Defines the stage cost as an exponential of the signed distance w.r.t. constraint set, K = [0, 3)
% INPUT: 
    % x: array of states (vector or matrix)
    % m: greater than or equal to 1, soft-max parameter
% OUTPUT: Stage cost

function c = stage_cost_pond( x, m ) 

gx = signed_distance_pond( x );  % signed distance with respect to the constraint set, K = [0, 3)

beta = 10^(-3);                  % scale down so LP CVX solver works for large m

c = beta * exp( m*gx );
